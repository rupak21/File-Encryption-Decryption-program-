"# File-Encryption-Decryption-program-" 
This C++ program allows you to encrypt and decrypt text files using the Caesar cipher encryption algorithm. The program prompts you to input the file names and encryption/decryption key. It then performs the operation and saves the result in a new file.

Caution: The Caesar cipher is a basic encryption method for educational purposes. For real-world use, consider more secure algorithms like AES or RSA.

Usage
Prepare a text file (input.txt) with the content to encrypt/decrypt.

Run the program and provide the input/output file names and key.

The program will create a new file with the encrypted/decrypted content.

Note: To decrypt, use the same key you used for encryption.
